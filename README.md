# Constraints

Constraints is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that helps enforce writing constraints in your vault. It’s inspired by [Oulipo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo).

This plugin is currently very bare-bones and not really intended for general use. While I would like to flesh it out and add a few more features, **all it does right now is optionally highlight uses of the letter `e` as you write.**
